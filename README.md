#### A Pokedex written using React, complete with a searchbox for live search. [View here.](https://mokyoxpokedexreact.netlify.com/)

I initially made this project to solidify my knowledge in React. Since then I've been updating this with small improvements in code structure, quality as well as adding and replacing and removing libraries. I originally made this React and Redux - the current iteration is now using React and Next.js.

Currently I'm using data taken from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and stored into data files located in `src/data/`. I plan use a GraphQL based version of PokeAPI at some point in the future that I made [here](https://github.com/mokyox/apollo-graphql-pokeapi).

Feel free to add an issue/pull request if you have any other questions.
