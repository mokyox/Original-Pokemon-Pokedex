# Original 151 Pokemon Pokedex

#### A Pokedex written using React, complete with a searchbox for live search. [View here.](https://mokyoxpokedexreact.netlify.com/)

I initially made this project to solidify my knowledge in React. Since then I've been updating this with small improvements in code structure, quality as well as adding and replacing libraries such as Redux with React Context API.

Currently I'm using data taken from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and stored into data files located in `src/data/`. I plan use a GraphQL based version of PokeAPI at some point in the future - any help/assistance is appreciated on that front.

Feel free to add an issue/pull request if you have any other questions about this project.
