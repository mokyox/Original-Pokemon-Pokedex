# React Pokedex

#### A Pokedex written using React and Redux, complete with a searchbox for live searching. [View here.](https://mokyoxpokedexreact.netlify.com/)

I've been making a Pokedex with React to solidify my fundamentals in React. I went through many iterations such as using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to call the data I needed for the Pokemon to the most current version, where data is stored as local files. I also added Redux in order to better manage the state of the Pokemon and to allow me to use a searchbox in the navbar.

Please feel free to send me a message or add an issue/pull request if you have any other questions about this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Update Feb 1st 2020
- Updated to use Hooks instead of class-based components.
